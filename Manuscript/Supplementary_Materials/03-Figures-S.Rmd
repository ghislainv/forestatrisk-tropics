(ref:cap-study-areas) **Study areas in the three continents: America, Africa, and Asia**. America included 64 study areas (39 countries), Africa included 32 study areas (32 countries), and Asia included 23 study areas (21 countries). Each country was identified by one unique three-letter code following the ISO 3166-1 standard (eg. MDG for Madagascar or GUF for French Guyana). In America, Brazil was divided in 26 study areas corresponding to the 26 Brazilian states. Each Brazilian state was defined by one unique two-letter code (eg. AM for Amazonas). For India, three study areas were considered: the Whestern Ghats (WG), the North-East India (NE), and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN). For Australia, we only considered the Queensland (QLD) state as a study area. In the three figures, each study area is identified by one unique code and a set of polygons with the same color. The horizontal lines on each figure indicate the position of the Equator (plain line) and the two tropics (Cancer at the North and Capricorn at the South, dashed lines).

<!-- Historical forest cover change maps -->
<!--------------------------------------------->

(ref:cap-fcc-maps) **Historical forest cover change maps**. This figure shows the forest cover change map on the period 2000--2010--2020 for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. \textcolor{orange}{orange}: 2000--2010 deforestation, \textcolor{red}{red}: 2010--2020 deforestation, \textcolor{darkgreen}{green}: forest cover in 2020. Forest cover change map was derived from the forest cover change annual product by @Vancutsem2020. Original resolution of the forest cover change map is 30 m. The inset at the bottom left shows a zoom of the map for an area at the North-East of the country which is close to the city of Beni and the Virunga national park. An interactive global forest cover change map is available at <https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr/tropics>.

<!-- Sampling -->
<!--------------------------------------------->

(ref:cap-sampling) **Data sampling for spatial modelling of the deforestation**. Map on the left corresponds to the bottom left inset in Fig. \@ref(fig:fcc-maps) representing a zoom of the forest cover change map on the period 2000--2010--2020 for an area at the North-East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Map on the right presents an inner zoom showing the delimitation of the 30 m forest pixels with three sample points. We used a stratified balanced sampling between (i) forest pixels in 2010 which have been deforested on the period 2010--2020 ("deforested" pixels in \textcolor{red}{red}), and (ii) forest pixels in 2010 which have not been deforested on that period of time and which represent the remaining forest in 2020 ("non-deforested" pixels in \textcolor{darkgreen}{green}). Forest pixels in each category were sampled randomly.
