# Introduction

**Context**

- Importance of modelling and forecasting deforestation.

**Gap**

- Difficult task as highly stochastic and mutlifactorial process.
- Deforestation process highly variable in space [@Vieilledent2018; @Yesuf2019]
- Spatial explanatory variables explain only a small part of the deforestation process [@Vieilledent2013]
- Socio-economic factors are often obtained at large spatial scale (administrative boundaries) and are weak informative factors for small scale deforestation [@Vieilledent2013]
- Bad models can lead to completely wrong projections

**Process-based vs. pattern-oriented models** [@Castella2007].

**Present study** Spatial autocorrelated random effect to account for unmeasured hidden factors explaining the residual spatial variability [@Clark2005].
