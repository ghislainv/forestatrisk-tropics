We are pleased to submit our enclosed manuscript entitled "Spatial forecasting of forest cover change in the humid tropics over the 21^st^ century" for publication in the _Science_ journal.

In this study, we model deforestation and forecast forest cover changes and associated carbon emissions over the course of the 21^st^ century using high spatial resolution data at pantropical scale.

We model the spatial risk of deforestation in the 92 countries which include all the tropical moist forests in the world. To do so, we use the most comprehensive datasets to date on key spatial factors determining the location of deforestation (including more than 85 thousand protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas and more than three millions roads from the OpenStreetMap project) and an advanced spatial statistical approach which takes into account the effect of unmeasured spatial factors in the deforestation process. To perform these analyses, we developed a specific Python package called `forestatrisk` which has been recently published in the Journal of Open Source Software (<https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02975>).

In this manuscript, based on the analysis of the past deforestation in the period 2000--2020, we demonstrate the effectiveness of protected areas in the tropics (protected areas reduce the risk of deforestation by 40%) and the negative impact of roads on tropical forest conservation (deforestation risk decreases by 13% at a distance of 10 km from the nearest road, and by 93% at a distance of 1 km from the forest edge). We derive high resolution (30 m) pantropical maps of the risk of deforestation for the year 2020 and of future forest cover over the course of the 21^st^ century considering a "business-as-usual" scenario of deforestation and taking into account the uncertainty associated with past deforestation estimate.

We show that 54% (46--61%) of the world's tropical moist forest is expected to disappear over the course of the 21^st^ century. We predict that 20 countries (6 in America, 8 in Africa, and 6 in Asia), five states in Brazil, and one region in India, which represent six biodiversity hotspots, will lose all their tropical moist forests by 2100. Tropical moist forests remaining in 2100 will be highly fragmented and concentrated in remote areas (far from roads and towns), preferentially in protected areas, and at high elevation. If the deforestation intensity remains constant, we predict that three quarters of the tropical moist forests that existed in 2000 will have disappeared around the years 2100, 2150, and 2200 in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, respectively.

As future deforestation will concern forests with higher carbon stocks, we show that annual aboveground carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation are expected to increase by +42% during the 21^st^ century (from 0.525 Pg/yr in 2010--2020 to 0.746 Pg/yr in 2070--2080) under a business-as-usual scenario of deforestation. As a consequence, tropical forests will likely act as an increasing net carbon source, thus reinforcing climate change in the future.

We think that our results could have strong implications in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss associated with tropical deforestation. Our results can contribute to the development of new biodiversity and climate change scenarios that could be incorporated into both IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports for decision-makers. At local scale, our high resolution maps of the risk of deforestation and of forest refuge areas in the future can be used for conservation projects and for implementing REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) activities in the framework of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

A website which provides full access to the code and data used in this study is accompanying our publication (<https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr>). The website also provides access to our resulting maps of the risk of deforestation and of the projected forest cover in 2050 and 2100. We have already discussed our model and results with a few scientists including two high level scientists from Brazil: Prof. Britaldo S. Soares-Filho from the Federal University of Minas Gerais and Luiz E.O.C. Aragão from the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil. They have both shown a great interest in our results although Prof. Soares-Filho can be considered as a competitor in this field of research. The authors declare that none of the material presented in this study has been published or is under consideration for publication elsewhere.
