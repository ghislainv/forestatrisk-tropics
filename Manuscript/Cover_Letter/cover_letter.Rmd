Please find enclosed the article entitled "Spatial forecasting of forest cover change in the humid tropics over the 21^st^ century" by Ghislain Vieilledent, Christelle Vancutsem, and Frédéric Achard, for publication in the _Science_ journal.

In this study, we model deforestation and forecast forest cover change and associated carbon emissions at pantropical scale over the 21^st^ century using high spatial resolution data (30 meter resolution).

We model the spatial risk of deforestation in 92 countries covering all the tropical moist forests in the world using large datasets on key spatial factors determining tropical deforestation (including 89,855 protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas and 3,606,841 roads from the OpenStreetMap project) and an advanced spatial statistical approach taking into account the effect of unmeasured spatial factors in the deforestation process. To perform these analyses, we developed a specific Python package (called `forestatrisk`) which has been recently reviewed and published in the Journal of Open Source Software (<https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02975>).

We demonstrate the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing deforestation in the tropics (on average, protected areas reduce the risk of deforestation by 40%) and the negative impact of roads on tropical forest conservation (on average, the deforestation risk decreases by 13% at a distance of 10 km from the nearest road, and by 93% at a distance of 1 km from the forest edge).

Considering a "business-as-usual" scenario of deforestation, we derive a pantropical map of the risk of deforestation at a spatial resolution of 30 meter for the year 2020 and project the future forest cover over the 21^st^ century. We take into account the uncertainty around the mean annual deforested area in our projections. Interactive maps of the risk of deforestation and of the projected forest cover in 2050 and 2100 at pantropical scale are available at the following web address: <https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr/maps.html>.

We show that 54% (46--61%) of the world's tropical moist forest is expected to disappear during the course of the 21^st^ century under a business-as-usual scenario of deforestation. We predict that 20 countries (6 in America, 8 in Africa, and 6 in Asia), five states in Brazil, and one region in India, each having more than one million hectares of forest in 2020, will lose all their tropical forests by 2100. These countries include most of the countries from Central America, Western and Eastern Africa, and South-East Asia which represent six biodiversity hotspots. Tropical moist forests remaining in 2100 will be highly fragmented and will be concentrated in remote areas (far from roads and towns), preferentially in protected areas, and at high elevation. If the deforestation intensity remains the same, we predict that the three quarters of the tropical moist forests that existed in 2000 will have disappeared around the years 2100, 2150, and 2200 in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, respectively.

As future deforestation will concern forests with higher carbon stocks, we show that annual aboveground carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation are expected to increase by +0.221 Pg/yr (+42%) during the 21^st^ century (from 0.525 Pg/yr in 2010--2020 to 0.746 Pg/yr in 2070--2080) under a business-as-usual scenario of deforestation. As a consequence, tropical forests will likely act as an increasing net carbon source, thus reinforcing climate change in the future.

We think our results could have strong implications in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss associated with tropical deforestation. At global scale, our results should contribute to the development of new biodiversity and climate change scenarios that could be incorporated into both IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports for decision-makers. At local scale, our detailed maps of the deforestation risk and potential forest refuge areas in the future should help conservation planning and facilitate the implementation on the ground of the UNFCCC REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) framework whose importance has been recognized in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The website provides links to all the code and data used to obtain the results of the study and an access to the high resolution maps. We have already discussed our model and results with two non-coauthor scientists: Britaldo S. Soares-Filho from the Federal University of Minas Gerais and Luiz E.O.C. Aragão from the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil. The authors declare that none of the material presented in this study has been published or is under consideration for publication elsewhere.
