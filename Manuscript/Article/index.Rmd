# Abstract {-}

Tropical forests are disappearing at an alarming rate because of human activities. Here we modelled spatially the anthropogenic deforestation process in 119 tropical territories (92 countries) including all the humid tropical forests in the world. We demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas at deplacing deforestation and the negative impact of road infrastructures on forest conservation globally. We derived high resolution global maps of the deforestation risk and likely future forest cover for the 21$^{\text{st}}$ century under a "business-as-usual" scenario. If large areas of tropical forest will still remain in 2100 at the heart of the Amazon, in the Congo Basin, and in New-Guinea, many countries will entirely lose their tropical forests before the end of the 21$^{\text{st}}$ century. Remaining forests will be strongly fragmented and located in remote places.

**Keywords:** deforestation, forecasts, forest cover change, forest refuge areas, moist tropical forests, spatial modelling, scenarios.

**One sentence summary:** Tropical moist forests will still exist at the end of the 21$^{\text{st}}$ century, but not everywhere in the tropics.
