# Abstract {-}

Tropical forests are disappearing at an alarming rate because of human activities. Here, we model the anthropogenic deforestation spatially in 92 countries covering all the tropical moist forests in the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of protected areas at displacing deforestation and the negative impact of roads on forest conservation globally. We derive high-resolution global maps of the deforestation risk and future forest cover for the 21^st^ century under a "business-as-usual" scenario. Although large areas of tropical moist forest would remain in 2100 at the heart of the Amazon, in the Congo Basin, and in New-Guinea under such scenario, 61% of the forest cover is expected to disappear during the 21^st^ century, and many countries will entirely lose their forests by 2100. The remaining forests will be strongly fragmented and located in remote places. As future deforestation will concern forests with higher carbon stocks, annual carbon emissions associated with tropical deforestation is expected to increase by +0.221 Pg/yr (+42%) during the 21^st^ century.

**Keywords:** deforestation, forecasts, forest cover change, forest refuge areas, moist tropical forests, spatial modelling, scenarios.

**One sentence summary:** The future of tropical moist forests over the 21^st^ century.
