(ref:cap-fcc2100) **Pantropical map of the projected forest cover change**. Pantropical map of the projected tropical moist forest cover change for the period 2020--2100 under a business-as-usual scenario of deforestation. The horizontal black line indicates the position of the Equator. Study areas' boundaries are represented by dark gray lines. Forest areas in \textcolor{red}{red} are predicted to be deforested in the period 2020--2100, while forest areas in \textcolor{darkgreen}{green} are likely to remain in 2100. Several countries in the three continents should experience a complete loss of their tropical moist forest by 2100 (including Nicaragua and Mexico in America, Madagascar and Ghana in Africa, and Laos and Vietnam in Asia). We predict a progressive fragmentation of the remaining forest in the future, with an increasing number of isolated forest patches of smaller size (e.g. Pará state in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Indonesia). The maps allow identifying both future hotspots of deforestation and forest refuge areas (e.g. concentrated in the heart of the Amazon, West Central Africa, and Papua New Guinea). An interactive map is available at <https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr/maps.html>, and a zoom of this map for the DRC is available in the Supplementary Materials.

<!-- Pantropical map of the spatial probability of deforestation -->

(ref:cap-prob) **Pantropical map of the spatial probability of deforestation**. Pantropical map of the spatial probability of deforestation computed for each tropical moist forest 30 m resolution pixel in 2020. Maps of the spatial probability of deforestation obtained at the study-area level were aggregated at the pantropical level. The horizontal black line indicates the position of the Equator. Study areas' boundaries are represented by dark gray lines. Inside each study-area, forest areas in dark red have a higher risk of deforestation than forest areas in green. At this scale, the effect of the distance to the forest edge and the effect of the distance to nearest river (see Amazon and Congo rivers) on the spatial probability of deforestation are well visible. An interactive map is available at <https://forestatrisk.cirad.fr/maps.html> and a zoom of this map for the Democratic Republic of the Congo is available in the Supplementary Materials. Effects of the other environmental explanatory variables (such as protected areas) on the spatial probability of deforestation are well visible on these maps.

(ref:cap-cem) **Carbon emissions associated with projected deforestation**. This figure displays the change in annual carbon emissions (Pg/yr) associated with the projected deforestation of the moist tropical forests. Mean annual carbon emissions are computed for ten-year intervals from 2010--2020 to 2090--2100. Points represent the observed mean annual carbon emissions (based on historical deforestation maps) for the period 2010--2020, for the three continents (America, Africa, and Asia), and for all continents together. Lines represent the projected mean annual carbon emissions (based on projected forest cover change maps) from 2020--2030 to 2090--2100 per continent, and for all continents together. Envelopes are obtained from the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals of the mean annual deforested areas for all the study-areas. Annual carbon emissions at the pantropical scale are predicted to increase from `r C_10_20` Pg/yr in 2010--2020 up to `r C_max` Pg/yr in 2070--2080, representing a 42% increase (+0.221 Pg/yr).

(ref:cap-probavar) **Effects of protected areas, roads, and distance to forest edge on the spatial probability of deforestation**. For this figure, we use a representative data-set at the global scale where the number of observations for each study-area is proportional to its forest cover in 2010. We used a total of 813,796 observations sampled in the original data-set (Table S3). _Left_: Points represent the observed mean probability of deforestation in each class of forest's protection status, either protected or unprotected. Bars represent the mean of the predicted probabilities of deforestation obtained from the deforestation model for all observations in each class. _Right_: Points represent the local mean probability of deforestation for each bin of 10 percentiles for the distances. Lines represent the mean of the predicted probabilities of deforestation obtained from the deforestation model for all observations in each bin. (Note that for distance to forest edge, the first point accounts for three bins while for distance to road, bins for a distance > 23 km are not shown).
